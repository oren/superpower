# Superpower Finder Bot

## What
'Find your superpower' bot

## So What
Knowing everyone's superpower on a team helps the team to communicate more effectively and provide insight into the team's operating model.

## Now What
```
./superpower --new

Hi, I am a bot that helps you find your superpowers. It will take you 30 mintues of playing.
I'll present you 30 stories and you'll pick the two that you think represent you. Let's get started!
```

## Details of the bot
The bot can be operated from the command line or from a website. Both interfaces use HTTP API to access the logic of the bot.

The Bot has 3 systems:
* CLI - command line interface
* Webite - web interface
* Server - HTTP API
* Core - Bot's logic

## Questions
* Can the CLI skip the HTTP API and talk directly to the core?
* Where does the Bot store it's content?
* Is there a need for a Database?
